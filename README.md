Sir, I’ve been trying to work on the Android Studio project but seriously, I’ve faced so many issues just trying to download and set up the software. It’s been frustrating because I really want to complete the project, but the technical problems just won’t let me move forward.



First of all, the Android Studio download itself is a huge problem. Every time I try to install it, the SDK packages either fail to download or it gets stuck midway. I get errors like "Failed to download SDK components" or “Unable to access URL”. I checked my internet multiple times, even tried switching to different networks, but it didn’t help. It keeps showing the same issue again and again.



Then when somehow the installation process starts, it never completes fully. It hangs on steps like “Installing SDK tools” or “Fetching components” and never finishes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, even restarted my laptop again and again, but the result is always the same.



And when one time it did install partially, I opened it and then a whole new problem started — Gradle sync failed. Without Gradle working properly, I can’t build or run the app. It keeps giving errors that I don’t even understand sometimes. I searched online for solutions, watched tutorials, followed step-by-step guides but nothing worked.



Another major issue is my laptop. It’s not very high-end, and Android Studio is super heavy. The software runs very slow, sometimes freezes, or completely crashes. The emulator doesn’t open at all. It says something about needing virtualization enabled, and I tried enabling it from BIOS too, but still it doesn’t work. I even tried using a physical device for testing, but Android Studio doesn’t detect the device.



All of these problems have made it nearly impossible for me to even start the project, let alone complete it. I genuinely want to do the work — I was excited to learn and build something in Android — but these technical issues are stopping me.



I’ve spent so much time just fixing these problems instead of actually working on the app. I feel really bad because I know the deadline is there and you’re expecting a complete project, but I honestly couldn't complete it because of these download and setup issues.



If it’s okay, I’m willing to submit something else to show my effort — like maybe the UI in Figma or XML layout design — just to show that I’ve learned something and tried my best. Please understand that I’m not making excuses, I’m just genuinely stuck and helpless due to all these Android Studio related issues.
